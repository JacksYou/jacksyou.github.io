# James You

I'm a compiler engineer at IBM working on the [OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9) Java Virtual Machine.
I mostly work on the Testarossa optimizer that forms the just-in-time compiler of OpenJ9.
The optimizer team is also responsible for the x86 and arm64 code generation backends so I occasionally dabble in those.

My interests are primarily in compiler optimization and managed runtimes.
I'm also interested in programming language design and static analyses.
I use this blog to write about projects I'm currently working on.
