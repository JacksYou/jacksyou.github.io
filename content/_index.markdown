# James You

I'm a compiler engineer at IBM working on the [OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9) Java Virtual Machine.
I mostly work on the Testarossa optimizer that forms the just-in-time compiler of OpenJ9.
The optimizer team is also responsible for the x86 and arm64 code generation backends so I occasionally dabble in those.
